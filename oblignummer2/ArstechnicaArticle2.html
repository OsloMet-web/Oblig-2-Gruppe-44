    <p>The venerable, equally derided and beloved MS Paint app has been on a roll lately, picking up a major <br>
    redesign, dark-mode support, better zoom controls, and other fit-and-finish updates all within the last <br>
    couple of years. But today Microsoft announced that it is finally adding two features that could make the app <br>
    a bit more useful for power users: support for Photoshop-esque image layers and the ability to open and <br>
    save transparent PNGs. </p>
 

   <h3>The changes</h3>

   <p>Support for creating, editing, and saving transparent PNG images goes hand in hand with support for layers,
    since it's useful to be able to pull a single object out of an existing image so you can put it in a new one. <br>
    Transparent PNG support goes well with the new automated background removal button that Microsoft added <br>
    to Paint builds earlier this month.</p>

   <p>Low-end image programs often have some kind of limit to the number of layers you can use in a single image. <br>
    Screenshots show as many as five separate layers, but it could be more. <br>
    It's also not clear what file format Paint uses to save works-in-progress with editable layers intactâ€”the Paint equivalent of a .PSD file, <br>
    in other words. We've asked Microsoft both of these questions and will update if we get any new info.</p>

    <h4>Conclusion</h4>

    <p> The redesigned Paint is rolling out to Windows Insider testers in both the Dev and Canary channels, <br>
    the two bleeding-edge and less-stable versions of Windows 11. Like other recent app updates, <br>
    this appears to require Windows 11 and won't be backported to Windows 10.</p>
