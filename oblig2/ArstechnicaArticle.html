  <p>Something has happend to MS Paint. The app has been totally changed. 
    The venerable, equally derided and beloved MS Paint app has been on a roll lately, 
    picking up a major redesign, dark-mode support, better zoom controls, 
    and other fit-and-finish updates all within the last couple of years. 
    But today Microsoft announced that it is finally adding two features that could make the app a bit more useful for power users: 
    support for Photoshop-esque image layers and the ability to open and save transparent PNGs. </p>
 
  <h3>The changes</h3>

  <p>Support for creating, editing, and saving transparent PNG images goes 
    hand in hand with support for layers, since it's useful to be able to 
    pull a single object out of an existing image so you can put it in a new one. 
    Transparent PNG support goes well with the new automated background removal button that 
    Microsoft added to Paint biulds earlier this month.</p>

  <p>Low-end image programs often have some kind of limit to the number of layers you can use in a single image. 
    Screenshots show as many as five separate layers, but it could be more. 
    It's also not clear what file format Paint uses to save works-in-progress with editable layers intactâ€”the Paint equivalent of a .PSD file, 
    in other words. We've asked Microsoft both of these questions and will update if we get any new info.</p>

  <h4>Conclusion</h4>

  <p> The redesigned Paint is rolling out to Windows Insider testers in both the Dev and Canary channels, 
    the two bleeding-edge and less-stable versions of Windows 11. Like other recent app updates, 
    this appears to require Windows 11 and won't be backported to Windows 10.</p>
